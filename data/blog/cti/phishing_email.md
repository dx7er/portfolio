In this blog, we are going to discuss social engineering attacks. Social engineering is a powerful tool in the arsenal of cybercriminals. Unlike technical exploits that target software vulnerabilities, social engineering attacks exploit human psychology to gain access to sensitive information or systems. 

### Social Engineering
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human psychology to gain access to confidential information, unauthorized systems, or perform fraudulent actions. It is a broad term that encompasses various malicious activities accomplished through human interactions, often relying on tricking people into breaking standard security procedures.

### Stages of Social Engineering
1. **Research:** Attacker gathers information about the target such as his/her `social media`, `public records`, `interests`, etc. In this stage `Attacker` also plans his social engineering attack and craft his `message`, `email`, etc.
2. **Hook:** After gaining information about victim, now the goal is to build trust to perform a desired action. Common methods include:
   - **Phishing Emails:** `Fraudulent emails` that appear to come from `trusted sources`.
   - **Phone Calls:** Calls posing as `technical support`, `customer service`, or other authoritative figures.
   - **Impersonation:** Physical encounters where the attacker impersonates `someone the target trusts`.
3. **Play:** During the play phase, the attacker exploits the established trust to achieve their objective. This invovles:
   - Extracting Information
   - Delivering Malware
   - Gaining Physical Access
4. **Exit:** After achieving their goal, the attacker `disengages` in a manner that minimizes `suspicion` and covers their tracks. This phase ensures that the target does not realize they have been manipulated, allowing the attacker to use the gained information or access without immediate detection.


### Types of Social Engineering
Following are types of Social Engineering
1. **Phishing:** Phishing is a cyberattack that leverages `email`, `phone`, `SMS`, `social media` or other form of personal communication to entice users to `click a malicious link`, `download infected files` or `reveal personal information`, such as passwords or account numbers.
2. **Whaling:** A whaling attack is a type of phishing attack that also leverages `personal communication` to  gain access to a userâ€™s device or personal information.
3. **Baiting:** Baiting is a type of social engineering attack wherein scammers make `false promises` to users in order to lure them into revealing `personal information` or installing `malware` on the system.
4. **Smishing:** SMS-phishing, or smishing, is a social engineering attack conducted specifically through `SMS` messages. In this attack, scammers attempt to lure the user into clicking on a link which directs them to a malicious site. Once on the site, the victim is then prompted to download malicious software and content.
5. **Hoenytrap:** A honeytrap attack is a social engineering technique that specifically targets individuals looking fo `online dating websites` or `social media`.

### Case Study
Six days ago, an email landed in Inbox showing me that my `Facebook` has been `HackedðŸ’€` and all of my security mesaures have been rolled backed. And the funny thin is all this was in `Vietrnamese` language. 

**Email I have recieved.**

Here is the screenshot of the `phishing email` I received:
