In this blog, we are going to discuss social engineering attacks. Social engineering is a powerful tool in the arsenal of cybercriminals. Unlike technical exploits that target software vulnerabilities, social engineering attacks exploit human psychology to gain access to sensitive information or systems. 

### Social Engineering
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human psychology to gain access to confidential information, unauthorized systems, or perform fraudulent actions. It is a broad term that encompasses various malicious activities accomplished through human interactions, often relying on tricking people into breaking standard security procedures.

### Stages of Social Engineering
1. **Research:** Attacker gathers information about the target such as his/her `social media`, `public records`, `interests`, etc. In this stage `Attacker` also plans his social engineering attack and craft his `message`, `email`, etc.
2. **Hook:** After gaining information about victim, now the goal is to build trust to perform a desired action. Common methods include:
   - **Phishing Emails:** Fraudulent emails that appear to come from trusted sources.
   - **Phone Calls:** Calls posing as technical support, customer service, or other authoritative figures.
   - **Impersonation:** Physical encounters where the attacker impersonates someone the target trusts.
3. **Play:**: During the play phase, the attacker exploits the established trust to achieve their objective. This invovles:
   - Extracting Information
   - Delivering Malware
   - Gaining Physical Access
4. **Exit:** After achieving their goal, the attacker disengages in a manner that minimizes suspicion and covers their tracks. This phase ensures that the target does not realize they have been manipulated, allowing the attacker to use the gained information or access without immediate detection.
